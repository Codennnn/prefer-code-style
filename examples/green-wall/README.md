## How it works

This project uses the GitHub GraphQL API to fetch data and uses Next.js API Routes to send requests. You can read [this file](./src/pages/api/contribution/%5Busername%5D.ts) to learn how we handle your data.

## Running Locally

This project uses the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql) to fetch data, so you need a personal access token for authentication. For more information, see "[Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) ."

After creating personal access token, create a file named `.env.local` at the root of the project, then paste the token into it.

```sh
# .env.local

# The format should be: GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="[YOUR TOKEN]"

# Example:
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="ghp_eQ81YcyFcwVjdJwBgUj150VPnxBf1N48Sep7"
```

Then you are ready to run `pnpm dev` to develop.
